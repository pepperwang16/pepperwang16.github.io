                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p> My name is Xiaoning/Pepper Wang (汪小甯). I'm a master of <strong>information studies</strong> student at <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/">McGill University</a>, as well as a passionate explorer at the intersection of technology and human experience.</p>
                    <h2 id="content">Academic Life</h2>
                    <p> My academic journey commenced with a Bachelor of Science in Psychology from the <strong>University of Toronto</strong>, where I developed a keen interest in the intricacies of the human mind and its interaction with technology. Therefore, I am diving deep into the world of Human-Computer Interaction and User Experience Design.</p>

                    <p> Currently, I am engaged in research at McGill's <a href="https://act.mcgill.ca/">ACT Research Group</a>, supervised by <a href="https://act.mcgill.ca/karyn/">Prof. Karyn Moffatt</a>, as well as <a href="https://aghenai.github.io/">Prof. Amira Ghenai</a>. My research interests focus on <strong>human-computer interaction (HCI) and accessibility</strong>, with a particular emphasis on combating <strong>misinformation</strong> on social media. I am also interested in exploring online communication dynamics and developing AI solutions to support and enhance people's interactions and experiences in digital environments.</p>

                    <h2 id="content">Extracurricular Life</h2>
                    <p>Outside the academic sphere, my passions lie in literature and music. I am an avid reader, a novelist at heart, and a violinist by choice. These are not mere pastimes but integral parts of who I am, infusing my professional path with rich creativity and profound empathy.</p>
