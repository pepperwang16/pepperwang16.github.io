                    <h2>Research Interests</h2>
                    <i>My research interests lie at the intersection of <strong>human-computer/AI interaction, misinformation, trust and accessibility</strong>. Specifically, my research focuses on improving information-seeking experiences by exploring the effects of emerging technologies, cognitive factors, and social dynamics. My current projects examine online health misinformation and trust in technology to create inclusive systems. Additionally, I aim to understand and address misinformation generated by evolving AI technologies.</i>
                    <i> I hope to contribute to building a future where all people can enjoy using technology.</i>

                    <h2>Project 1: COVID-19 misinformation spread and effect on older adults</h2>
                    <p>The objective of this project is to elucidate the mechanisms through which senior individuals navigate and counteract misinformation related to the coronavirus on digital platforms. This inquiry focuses on delineating the specific obstacles encountered by this demographic in the pursuit of accurate information online and explores their strategies for addressing these challenges amidst the COVID-19 crisis.</p>
                    <p>Employing methodologies such as online questionnaires and telephonic interviews, this study aims to assess the extent of engagement of older adults with digital resources for acquiring information about COVID-19, their exposure to and interaction with misinformation concerning the virus, and their level of acquaintance with the countermeasures implemented by various online platforms to mitigate the spread of such misinformation.</p>

                    <h2>Project 2: Increasing the perceived intimacy in online chats to improve the effectiveness of misinformation interventions within families.</h2>
                    <p>The spread of misinformation through online platforms, particularly within family group chats, presents a significant threat to societal well-being. Studies have demonstrated that one effective approach for correcting misinformation is to engage individuals who have close personal ties or a perceived shared identity, like family members. Family members' unique role in both addressing misinformation spread within family messaging groups and challenging misinformation beliefs externally presents significant opportunities for intervention. </p>
                    <p>However, there are still some challenges that they may face when engaging in misinformation interventions. In some specific cultures, there is a strict hierarchy within the family and challenging the views of more senior members may be perceived as disrespectful behavior. Additionally, when family members communicate with each other through online communication that lacks emotional connection and intimacy, it increases the likelihood of conflicts due to disagreements. Each of these potential challenges may prevent people from correcting misinformation shared within these families. </p>
                    <p>This study aims to address the unique challenges faced by this demographic, such as cultural conflicts and diminished intimacy in online communication. I conducted semi-structured interviews with 20 Chinese-Canadian young adults to explore their misinformation-sharing and correction experiences, emphasizing East-West cultural dynamics. This ongoing project aims for publication in January 2025.</p>
