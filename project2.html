                <h1>Family online chats</h1>
                <h2>Objectives</h2>
                <p>The spread of misinformation through online platforms, particularly within family group chats, presents a significant threat to societal well-being. Studies have demonstrated that one effective approach for correcting misinformation is to engage individuals who have close personal ties or a perceived shared identity, like family members. Family members' unique role in both addressing misinformation spread within family messaging groups and challenging misinformation beliefs externally presents significant opportunities for intervention.</p>
                <p>However, there are still some challenges that they may face when engaging in misinformation interventions. In some specific cultures, there is a strict hierarchy within the family and challenging the views of more senior members may be perceived as disrespectful behavior. Additionally, when family members communicate with each other through online communication that lacks emotional connection and intimacy, it increases the likelihood of conflicts due to disagreements. Each of these potential challenges may prevent people from correcting misinformation shared within these families.</p>
                <h2>Methodologies</h2>
                <p>This study aims to address the unique challenges faced by this demographic, such as cultural conflicts and diminished intimacy in online communication. I conducted semi-structured interviews with 11 Chinese-Canadian young adults to explore their misinformation-sharing and correction experiences, emphasizing East-West cultural dynamics. This ongoing project aims for publication in January 2025.</p>
