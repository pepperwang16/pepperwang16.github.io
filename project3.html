                <h1>Trust in AI</h1>
                <h2>Obejctives</h2>
                <p>Traditional search engines such as Google have long been the cornerstone for such searches, but the emergence of Generative AI (GenAI)-powered tools, such as ChatGPT, introduces new dynamics in user interaction and trust formation. Our study seeks to address a research gap in understanding how GenAI-powered tools and types of search targets influence user behavior during health-related searches. </p>
                <h2>Methodologies</h2>
                <p> Standard significance testing will be used to examine the effect of the treatments on the dependent variable, such as  trust and distrust levels associated with the different search engines used. Repeated measures ANOVA will be employed to analyze these effects within subjects, providing insights into which search engines yield higher trust and satisfaction. Additionally, correlation analyses will investigate relationships between the task type and participants' trust and distrust. Descriptive statistics will provide a baseline understanding of the data distribution, and post hoc tests will further clarify differences between treatments if significant results are found in the ANOVA.
